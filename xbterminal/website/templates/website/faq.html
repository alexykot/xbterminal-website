                    <h2>The terminal</h2>
                    <div class="question">
                        <h3>So is it a card payment terminal?</h3>
                        <p>
                            No, it's a Bitcoin payment terminal, and it is designed to work with smartphones that have mobile bitcoin wallets installed.
                            Of course, since XBTerminal is designed to work with Bitcoin network directly, it can accept payments from online and desktop wallets also,
                            although this might be a rare occasion for in person payments.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="question">
                        <h3>So how does it work?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Check the video to see the process, if you've not seen it yet, and here is the explanation.
                            <ol>
                              <li>Merchant types in the amount to be paid, in their local currency</li>
                              <li>Terminal fetches the current exchange rate.</li>
                              <li>Amount to pay in bitcoins is then shown on the screen.</li>
                              <li>Client unlocks their phone and touches terminal NFC antenna.</li>
                              <li>Amount, address and merchant name are sent to the client's phone over NFC. Bitcoin wallet app is opened on client's phone automatically with all data prefilled.</li>
                              <li>Client hits "pay" button on their phone.</li>
                              <li>In few seconds transaction will be propagated to the Bitcoin network, the terminal receives and verifies it.</li>
                              <li>Payment done!</li>
                            </ol>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If it so happens that client's phone is not NFC-enabled, the process looks like this:
                            <ol>
                              <li>Merchant types in the amount to be paid, in their local currency</li>
                              <li>Terminal fetches the current exchange rate.</li>
                              <li>Amount to pay in bitcoins is then shown on the screen.</li>
                              <li>Client unlocks their phone, and then a Bitcoin wallet app.</li>
                              <li>Merchant hit's "QR" button on the terminal. A QR code is shown on the terminal.</li>
                              <li>Client scans QR code from the terminal screen with their phone.</li>
                              <li>Amount, address and merchant name are sent to the client's phone over NFC. Bitcoin wallet app is opened on client's phone automatically with all data prefilled.</li>
                              <li>Client hits "pay" button on their phone.</li>
                              <li>In few seconds transaction will be propagated to the Bitcoin network, the terminal receives and verifies it.</li>
                              <li>Payment done!</li>
                            </ol>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So at any point in time neither phone nor terminal change hands. They just interact in the hand's of merchant and client.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="question">
                        <h3>What is NFC?</h3>
                        <p>
                            NFC stands for Near Field Communication.
                            It's a method of communication between devices that works on distance of no more than roughly two inches.
                            It's used in various things around, like contactless payment cards, and also is available in
                            most Android smartphones (also called Android Beam). It is not available in any iPhone, but
                            don't worry iPhone users, check next answer.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="question">
                        <h3>What if I don't have NFC in my phone?</h3>
                        <p>
                            If your phone doesn't support NFC - fallback to QR code based interaction is still available.
                            Of course it's not as smooth, quick and easy, but it's a proven and widely used way for bitcoin payments.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="question">
                        <h3>Can I pay with my contactless NFC payment card?</h3>
                        <p>
                            No. Although it is also NFC, NFC in smartphone and in payment card are not exactly same thing.
                            And of course - your payment card has nothing to do with Bitcoin, and this is a Bitcoin-based system.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="question">
                        <h3>Is it safe?</h3>
                        <p>
                            It's nearly as safe as the Bitcoin network itself. Each terminal is a full Bitcoin network node,
                            and uses most recent bitcoind software with all security updates installed.
                            Also each terminal inside itself is encrypted to prevent in-person tampering.
                            And the whole system is decentralized, with no central server or storage vault to be attacked.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="question">
                        <h3>What do you mean "decentralized"?</h3>
                        <p>
                            This means that each terminal is acting by itself, it issues address for payment, calculates amounts,
                            accepts and verifies transactions, and sends funds further to merchant's wallet or payment processing service like BitPay.
                            But there is no single place where all funds are gathered, central server or cold storage.
                            So there is no single place for attack or failure.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="question">
                        <h3>Is this hardware PCI compliant?</h3>
                        <p>
                            PCI stands for Payment Card Industry. There are no payment cards involved in this system,
                            so this terminal technically impossible to make PCI compliant.
                            A supersonic jet cannot be compliant to cargo ship rules.

                    <div class="question">
                        <h3>How is this better than a cheap mobile phone with a merchant app, doing the same thing?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Oh, there are plenty of advantages:
                            <ol>
                              <li>Security. This is a dedicated hardware with limited low level access, so nobody will
                                  install random (and potentially compromising) apps onto it.</li>
                              <li>Security. This is a full Bitcoin node, so the level of transaction verification reliability
                                  will be always higher than for a light client on the smartphone.</li>
                              <li>Security. A dedicated device will rarely be a target for thiefs, while an expensive smartphone
                                  on the counter is always at risk.</li>
                              <li>Reliability. An industrial grade dedicated hardware will always be more reliable and long-living
                                  than consumer devices.</li>
                              <li>Usability. An all purpose universal device like a smartphone has to be good for everything,
                                  at a trade off of being not completely perfect for certain areas.
                                  A dedicated device can be designed perfectly for the cause, with no trade offs for other
                                  use cases.</li>
                              <li>Price. On the same level of mass production, dedicated device will have a more specialized
                                  and cheaper hardware, and will always outperform the allpurpose device with plenty of
                                  features not used in this particular case.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </p>

                            Merchant has two ways to get his money. One way is to specify his own bitcoin address,
                            in any wallet he has, and all incoming payments will be sent into it.
                            Another way is to register with bitcoin payment processor (BitPay, BIPS or CryptoPay) and get
                            bitcoins instantly converted into fiat money and automatically withdrawn into his account.

                            If merchant receives funds in bitcoins - BitcoinAverage rate is used for conversions.
                            If payment processor is used for instant conversion into fiat - payment processor rates are used.
